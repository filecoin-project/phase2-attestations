# Filecoin Trusted Setup Phase2 Attestations

### Trusted-Setup Phase1 v.s. Phase2

### Mapping of Filecoin Releases to Attestation Files

A new trusted-setup phase2 will occur prior to Filecoin's mainnet launch and each time
Filecoin's zk-SNARKs are upgraded during network upgrades. The following table will be used to track
the contribution attestations of each participant in each trusted-setup.

The `Circuit` column in the table below follows the format:
